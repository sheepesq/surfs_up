# Overview of the analysis #
- the point of this analysis was to get a weather breakdown for the months of June and December and display the information in a manner that it can easily be read at first glance.



# Results #
- In June and December the weather will be in the 70s, 75 for June and 71 December, both are Ice Cream weather. That means just from this intiial observation it looks like you can keep the store open all year long and have customers every month.

# Summary #
- This information just looks like to be the first set of data out of many that would need to be looked at before opening a shop. Besides the temperature you need to look at the amount of ice cream stores already on the island to see if the market is saturated or not. I would also look into how often it rains year round. People tend not to get ice cream when it is raining. I would obtain rain via `results = session.query(Measurement.date, Measurement.prcp)`.
